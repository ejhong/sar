# What is being tested

This notebook evaluates conditional feasibility and failure mechanisms. It does
not reproduce the original Khafre data or claim that a failed reconstruction
settles the existence of underground columns.

Three methods must remain distinguishable:

1. Biondi and coauthors' published descriptions and original implementation.
2. The public **derivative** protocol v1.5, inspected at revision
   `81451263db5a5ab4624b74d64ee65cb1b611b453` of
   [Replication and Verification](https://github.com/BiondiProtocol/Replication-and-Verification-Biondi-Protocol/tree/81451263db5a5ab4624b74d64ee65cb1b611b453).
   Its README acknowledges missing original details and added empirical choices.
3. This repository's specified simulation and processing choices.

## Corrected selection and focusing

The previous ellipse implementation maximized adjusted R² over *both windows
and modes* before gating. A perfect one-dimensional fit could defeat a slightly
noisier accepted ellipse in another window. The regression in `tests/test_gates.py`
constructs that counterexample.

`sarsim/gates.py` now chooses the best harmonic separately in each W25 window,
then tests adjusted R² ≥ 0.25, minor/major axis ≥ 0.1 and minor semiaxis ≥ 0.005 px.
`focus_branch_b` in `sarsim/tomo.py` restricts real two-component least-squares
fitting to those accepted windows. No accepted window yields NaN scores and
window index -1. The ungated branch remains available as a diagnostic/reference.
Legacy complex projection is not presented as the derivative selective branch.

T6 and T7 have been rerun with per-window selection. Gate counts refer to
dependent target samples, not independent field detections.

## Nuisance and geometry

New independent-scene controls use two separate ten-sample flanks at least 48 px
from the target strip. Each side is aggregated by a two-component geometric
median; their mean is subtracted. Side disagreement and target identities are
recorded. The older T1–T7 figures retain their declared global-median correction.
The physical reflector comparison assumes favorable zero nuisance rather than
pretending to implement a terrain-based flank correction on seven isolated points.

Our registration uses complex 32×32 patches and Fourier refinement. It does not
implement every context-window refinement described in derivative documentation.
Our synthetic geometry is straight-line and flat-earth, with an explicit
frequency-to-effective-time mapping. Real-product state vectors, azimuth
resampling, support, autofocus and acquisition timing have not been validated.

## Physical benchmark

The new chain is:

`2D shear-wave cavity model → surface displacement → phase-modulated radar channels → focused SLC → favorable phase readout → physical template inverse`.

The forward wave solver never uses the Doppler-to-depth steering formula.
Forward evaluation uses 2.5 m spacing and depths 70, 110, 150, 190 and 230 m.
The prediction library uses 5 m spacing and a disjoint 20 m depth grid. Both
share an SH wave-equation family: this is not an independent field validation or
an independently implemented elastodynamic solver.

The cavity is an infinite **horizontal** cylindrical hole in a 2D anti-plane
model, with radius 20 m, a known active Ricker source, uniform rock and no intrinsic
attenuation. A shared cavity-free reference sets the force/displacement scale;
targets are never normalized individually. The source is not a model of ambient
excitation. Three-dimensional columns, spiral geometry and kilometre-scale
depth are outside the simulated domain.

The radar is a stationary-phase spectral approximation with seven separated
reflectors, a specified SH-to-line-of-sight projection, independent complex
receiver noise and invertible azimuth focusing. Readout uses known range supports
and removes constant phase. These favorable conditions avoid claiming that a
practical distributed-ground extraction method has been built. Noise trials use
the algebraically equivalent separated-channel readout; explicit focused-image
round trips verify the equality. SNR is per channel/aperture sample, not a measured
image SNR at Giza.

The reference inverse profiles a positive unknown source gain against physical
wave templates. Its candidates and null thresholds are fixed before their
evaluation observations are scored. Evaluation depths are withheld from the
library; source location and timing are known in the favorable case. This is a
held-out automated benchmark, not formal human blinding or a preregistered trial.
The 20/40/60 dB sweep was added after low recovery in the initial 20 dB study;
it uses separate seeds and new null calibration. The entire sweep, including
failures, is reported.

## Controls and uncertainty

Each detection threshold uses independent cavity-free calibration noise.
Evaluation nulls include finer-mesh discrepancy. The notebook reports misses,
localization, and false alarms together, including cases where model mismatch
breaks the nominal 1% threshold. Wilson intervals summarize noise-run variation
under specified models; repeated noise draws are not new geological sites.

Independent stationary image realizations preserve correlations induced by the
sub-aperture bank. Arbitrary look shuffles in legacy T6 do not preserve those
correlations and are retained only as historical diagnostics. Shape-only passes
are not false positives of the full rule.

The source-ambiguity test fits unrestricted complex forcing at one frequency.
Seven weights can match seven receivers, and fourteen held-out receivers test
generalization. This conditional non-uniqueness example does not establish that
such forcing occurs at Khafre or that broadband, constrained inference is impossible.

## Real observations

`scripts/inspect_sar.py` provides metadata-only inspection by default and explicit,
bounded native-image crops. It supplies no default simulation geometry and makes
no depth inference. HDF5 I/Q and memory-mappable complex TIFF are supported;
SICD/NITF uses optional sarpy. Compressed TIFFs require a separate windowed reader.
Published depth results remain synthetic. Real Giza and Sacsayhuaman acquisitions
have passed preliminary metadata and small-sample read checks. The separate
`scripts/audit_iceye_geometry.py` evaluates native RPC geolocation metadata,
reports height sensitivity and metadata-coordinate residuals, and checks the
companion SICD dimensions when supplied. It reads no SAR pixels and establishes
neither independent landmark registration nor depth accuracy. Historical
[Giza survey candidates](research/giza_known_voids.md) have been identified;
qualified field labels and evaluated chamber detections remain pending.

Before field interpretation: verify product metadata and physical aperture
support, freeze regions and processing, include known motion and static controls,
compare independent acquisitions, and evaluate surveyed cavities plus matched
intact ground at sites excluded from calibration. Unknown subsurface labels
cannot serve as confirmed negatives. Repeated features alone do not exclude
stable surface artifacts.
